## Abstract

- NCF 2005 mathematics position paper has identified some concern areas which needs attention to work towards systemic reform in the mathematics education. 
- We are keen to understand the narratives of middle school mathematics educators while they explore turtle graphics approach keeping in sight the higher goals and vision of mathematics education as envisaged in NCF 2005.
- We are curious to understand their perception, concerns and challenges during the stint and how do they critically reflect on their learning journey.
- The pilot study is important to us in following ways. 
  - Firstly, the study would also help us understand the perpective of mathematics educators, potential barriers they envisage, and whether they would be interested to integrate turtle graphics approach in their current practices.
  - Secondly, the study will give us some insights on how do educators interpret and reflect on the nature of mathematical knowledge construction during the engagement.
  - Thirdly, the study would give insights on how do educators pay attention to the cited concerns for equitable mathematics education  in limited context of exploring turtle graphics as a practice
  - Lastly, we would be able to have a better understanding the nature and dynamics of engagement in an online cohort setting centered around a shared goal/interest - here "Exploring the turtle graphics together!" which are first step towards seeding a sustainable community of practice. 
  
We are also open to explore the emerging tension and how do the educators negotiate those during their interaction in conversation with peers and researchers. These insights and experiences will hopefully guide the direction of future studies.

## Introduction

- Literature suggests that turtle Graphics could be an interesting way to meaningfully introduce mathematical ideas to young people especially related to geometric reasoning  in an exploratory and discovery rich computational environment. 
- Its affordance to support creation of digital artifact using myriad ways, easy to learn interface, lego-like tinkerability and modularity of the program structure, and visual feedback which reframe failure as a source of new discovery and insights makes it a potential playground for authentic exploration.
- Foregrounding creative exploration and agency are also in alignment with the ideas espoused by the Dewey and Montessori which are crucial for meaningful learning.
- These design features positions turtle Graphics approach in a different genre of ICT integration in schooling as compared to smart board, simulation based learnings or game based approaches.

In next section, we briefly elaborate on the design features which makes turtle Graphics a conducive choice for this pilot.

## Design Features of turtle Graphics

### Visual feedback

At the core of the turtle Graphics approach, is to tinker in a computationally rich "art-based" context. 
If something goes wrong, one gets a graphics which they may not have anticipated. This may trigger new trajectory of exploration and inquiry. The ability to iteratively run the program and generate different visual result in every loop encourages participants to take risk without potential resource-constraining implication. The visual prompt when the things don't go the way participant predicted becomes a starting point to examine the code structure, making the entire ecosystem as a source of surprise and awe.

### Tinkerability

The limited set of commands, their ease of recombination and parameteric tweaking makes it easier for novices to acquire minimal functional knowledge to start tinkering. The same playground affords a more experienced learner to dive into deeper inquiry and exploration of phenomena augmenting advance computational concepts. This makes the playground pedagogically sound, enriching and rewarding to both beginners and advance learners. There is no explicit notion of levels likes in the conventional games where the difficulty level gradually increases. The participants current understanding and readiness determine the complexity of code structure for a certain design challenge allows learner to determine their learning trajectory.

Hence, the **visual feedback** which prompts self-correction, iterative mode which encourages failure, its **tinkerability** which allows multiple ways to reach right answer and the **low-thresold, high ceiling** design which makes it easy for novices to get started as well as enticing for experienced to spend hours discovering new ideas, makes the arena attractive for diverse participation.

## Rationale selecting the application

There has been 200+ instances and derivatives of LOGO since 1970s. With development of web 2.0, new kind of learning environments has been developed. Turtle Blocks and Scratch is two popular derivatives which originated from the LOGO. 

Scratch was launched in 2008. During last decade, it has attracted attention of several scholars to analyse different aspects of the program and it probably is among the largest online community where educators and teachers collaborate to create and share digital artifact's using multi-media and animation. 

Turtle Blocks was designed by Walter Bender et. al. It is also a block based programming language/

While both these platforms are based on block-based programming, scratch focuses on enabling participants to create animated stories whereas turtle blocks primarily focus on computationally generated graphics. 

These platforms  share similar benefits and critiques by scholars on the potential claim for smooth transition from block to text based programming environments. The debate is not settled and the concern needs further investigation.

For this study, we decided to use a hybrid approach. Instead of tieing up to a particular application, we decided to focus on the few key principles which are shared across instances of LOGO derivatives. These are common across almost all similar computational platforms. These also share the practices cited by Brennan and Resnik in their computational thinking framework.

**Access**
The last pilot which we did with cohort, some of the participants didn't have laptop. The advantage of python is that is fully compatible with the mobile based media. This increases the access to participation for those who couldn't have participated if they joined via computer alone. However, there is downside that they have to start with probably a conceptually tougher trajectory. (Again, not clear though)

**Free and Open Source**
Both of these are free and open source too.

**Syntatical familiarity**
For this study, we decided to go with the following two instances

- Turtle Blocks: For the block based approach, turtle blocks was the most suitable options as it has a text-based library written in python too.
- Python turtle: Python of the most popular programming language included the turtle Graphics library in 200x this comes as inbuilt with python 3 +  version. 


## Concerns area - mathematics education

There are certain concern areas identified by the position paper on mathematics as part of NCF 2005,
- instill fear
- disappoints both talented minority and non-participating majority
- tall and spindly nature of curriculum
- no systemic structure for teacher support and professional development
- curricular acceleration
- Compartmentalisation
- Gender dimension
	- Lack of role model in textbook
	- Classroom studies on perception

**Compartmentalisation**
This is primarily due to the lack of networking and cross-talk between the various stateholders and working towards an evolving dynamic pedagogy in a "systemic" way. For instance, the school teachers hardly get opportunity to share practices between each other, nor there is any systemic way to interact with practicising mathematics scholars.

**Curriculum accelearation:**
Topics which were earlier introduced at college level, have slowly been incorporated in high school curriculum. The rationale may be to introduce these topics early since they are of use at the UG level. However, this approach has rendered the existing curriculum "tall and spindly" rather than "broad and round", further causing alientation among non-participating majority. Not just that, it also has implication leading to purging of the "other topics" like solid geometry.

**Gender Dimension:**
The perception of mathematics in schooling has been perceived as masculine by many scholors and is another concern area identified in NCF too. Studies have indicated lack of women role models in the textbooks to be one of the problems along with designing problems without it's contextual characteristics. The norm has been further reinforced by classroom culture where the boys are perceived to be smarter and have been gifted with natural talent whereas the girls' success is attributed more to the "hard work". Lack of systemic effort to inadvertently not paying attention to this dimension has led to widening of the gap.

We are curious to explore the perspective of mathematics educators how do they think about the pros/cons of turtle graphics approach in being attentive and responsive to the above cited concerns.

## Research questions

- We are curious to understand the perceptions, concerns challenges experienced by educators and opportunities they foresee in augmenting turtle Graphics approach in their middle school mathematics classrooms after/during they participation in the six-week of online professional development program to introduce the turtle graphics approach via synchronous and asynchronous online medium. 
- We are keen to understand this in relation to their experience of integrating technology in classrooms as well as their participation and engagement towards building an online community of practice
- We are also curious to understand how does the educators reflect and make sense of the mathematical knowledge construction while exploring turtle Graphics? How is this experience different/similar to their prior experiential base for teaching and learning mathematics? 
- We are keen to get feedback on their orientation program design itself so that we understand the parts of program which went well and other which might be improved based on the feedback from the cohort.

Overall, the pilot will pave way for us to examine the larger narrative around inter-disciplinary integration, its opportunities and challenges and also design an intervention where we can explore co-creation of design activities with interested teachers which are contextual in nature instead the top-down approach which has been conventionally practiced while designing curriculum. We are hoping that we will also get insights to understand how an online community of practice can be seeded in the education context.

## Setting and participants



## Implementation Design

- A cohort will be limited to interested participants mathematics educators in this iteration. There will be initial orientation session followed up with a design based tasks during the engagement.
- There will be a brief orientation session where the foundational concepts of turtle Graphics will be shared via open-ended as well as design-based challenges.
- During pilot phase, the cohort will be meeting weekly once for 6 weeks for 90 min duration.
- During this phase, teachers will be encouraged to design challenge collaboratively or individually and maintain a digital portfolio.
- The cohort will be sub-divided into groups of two/three to work along. The regular meetings will have both the components, breakout session and joint reflection. 
- There will be feedback from peers to refine the design.
- The effort would also be towards understanding the dispositions, learning and challenges during the process.
- There will be shared reflection on the gaps.
